Sample Golang Project - Version 2
---------------------------------

This is a simple Golang library in version 2 to show how to import a library to other projects.

You can use the library for example in our own application like this:
```
package main

import somelib "github.com/sourcefellows/somelib/v2"

func main() {

	somelib.CallLibV2()

}
```
